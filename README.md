# bParticles
SUPER Lightweight, 0 dependancies Javascript Particle library that I developed to add subtle particle detail to projects, creating a **more dynamic experience** for users, on pages that risk being boring and disengaging.

### DEMO
An example of this Particle library can be found at http://lucasbowers.com/bParticles/
